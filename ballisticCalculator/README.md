# Risk Matrix for Weapon Calculator Module

## Introduction
This README presents a risk matrix for the Weapon Calculator module. The module performs ballistic calculations, and it's essential to identify potential risks associated with its usage. 

## Risk Matrix

| Risk                                                  | Impact                                                                  | Probability                                                             | Mitigation                                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Errors in ballistic calculations                      | Reduction in shooting accuracy                                           | Moderate                                                                 | Thorough testing of ballistic calculations, cross-verification of results.                           |
| Inaccurate or outdated weapon data                    | Inaccuracy in calculations of effects on perfect distance                | Moderate                                                                 | Regular verification and updating of weapon data.                                                     |
| Variations in environmental conditions                | Significant deviation from expected projectile trajectory               | High                                                                     | Continuous monitoring of environmental conditions and adjustment accordingly.                         |
| Errors in interpretation or application of results   | Erroneous shooting or incorrect weapon adjustment                       | Moderate                                                                     | Adequate training for users on how to interpret and apply results correctly.                          |

## Usage
Ensure that the risks identified in the matrix are considered during the development, testing, and deployment phases of the Weapon Calculator module. Regularly assess and update the risk matrix to reflect changes in the system or its environment.
